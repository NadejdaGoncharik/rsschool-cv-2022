## **About me:**

I used to work as an accountant until last year. And I wanted to change my life. So I decided to try myself in IT and began to learn different areas in this sphere. I have completed courses in manual testing and now I am starting this frontend course. I'm very excited about it. 

I like new challenges, that made me want to learn more and more about this sphere and improve my skills every day. My objective is to excel in a challenging and innovative work environment and aim to exercise my full potential. 

My goal is to succeed in Front End. I want to be a popular and competitive specialist in the job market. I consider myself a valuable employee, because I always go to my goal, hardworking and ready to help. IMy English level is Pre-Intermediate.
